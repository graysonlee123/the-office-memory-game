# "The Office (US)" Memory Game

### Click [here](https://graysonlee123.github.io/memory-game/) to play the game

A React webpage memory game. It uses React's components with local states. The components are conditionally rendered, and the state of components change throughout the game. 

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to click on each person *once* per round. If they user clicks on the same character twice in one round, the round ends. You'll know the round is over because all of the cards shake at the same time. If you succesfully click everyone in the Office once, you win the round, and get confetti and a quote from The Office as a reward!

Users can also define how many cards they want by using the slider on the left. This can drastically change the game's difficulty.
